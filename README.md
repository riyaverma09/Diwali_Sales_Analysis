📌 About the Project

This project analyzes Diwali Sales Data to uncover business insights and customer buying behavior.
Users can explore sales trends by gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, and product categories.

Dataset: A Diwali sales dataset containing customer details, product categories, purchase amounts, and demographics.
