## 📌 About the Project

This project analyzes Diwali Sales Data to uncover business insights and customer buying behavior.
Users can explore sales trends by gender, age, state, marital status, occupation, and product categories.

Dataset: A Diwali sales dataset containing customer details, product categories, purchase amounts, and demographics.

Diwali Sales Data.csv was preprocessed (handling null values, renaming columns, filtering irrelevant data).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Sales patterns were studied based on demographic attributes like Gender, Age Group, State, Marital Status, and Occupation.
